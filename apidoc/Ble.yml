summary: Add-on Bluetooth Low Energy module
since: "1.0.0"
description: |
    Using Bluetooth Low Energy module is used to interact with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.
    Note (IOS): Starting iOS 13, it's mandatory for developers to specify the Privacy Usage Description for Bluetooth by including NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription in their tiapp.xml file. 
    Otherwise accessing any Core Bluetooth APIs would lead to a crash. For backward support for older iOS versions, NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription needs to be defined.
    If your app needs to run in background to perform certain Bluetooth-related tasks, it must declare that it supports a Core Bluetooth background execution mode in tiapp.xml using UIBackgroundModes key
      <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
      <array>
          <string>bluetooth-central</string>
          <string>bluetooth-peripheral</string>
      </array>
      bluetooth-central : The app communicates with Bluetooth low energy peripherals using the Core Bluetooth framework.
      bluetooth-peripheral :The app shares data using the Core Bluetooth framework.
      The Apple documentation states that applications are allowed to scan while backgrounded but the scan must specify the service types. wild card scan is not supported in the background.

        This method requires the BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN permissions to successfully work. To check
        whether these permissions are granted or not, call
        [isBluetoothAndBluetoothAdminPermissionsGranted](Modules.BLE.isBluetoothAndBluetoothAdminPermissionsGranted) method.
        Listen for the [didUpdateState](Modules.BLE.didUpdateState) event to be notified when the local
        Bluetooth adapter is turning off.
    since: "1.0.0"
    platforms: [android]
    returns:
      type: "Boolean"
      summary: "Returns true if the process is initiated successfully or when the bluetooth is already off."

  - name: enable
    summary: Enables the local Bluetooth adapter.
