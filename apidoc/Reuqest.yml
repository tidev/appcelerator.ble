name: Modules.BLE.Request
summary: A request that uses the Attribute Protocol (ATT).
description: |
    The class represents Attribute Protocol (ATT) read and write requests from remote central devices (represented by Central objects). Remote centrals use these ATT requests to read and write characteristic values on local peripherals (represented by PeripheralManager objects). Local peripherals, on the other hand, use the properties of Request objects to respond to the read and write requests appropriately, using the respondToRequest() method of the PeripheralManager class.
