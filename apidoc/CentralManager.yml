events:
  - name: didUpdateState
    summary: A event called when centrel manager state updated
    description: |
         Invoked whenever the central manager's state has been updated. Commands should only be issued when the state is
         Modules.BLE.CENTREL_MANAGER_STATE_POWERED_ON. A state below Modules.BLE.CENTREL_MANAGER_STATE_POWERED_ON
         implies that scanning has stopped and any connected peripherals have been disconnected. If the state moves below
         Modules.BLE.CENTREL_MANAGER_STATE_POWERED_OFF, all Peripheral objects obtained from this central
         manager become invalid and must be retrieved or discovered again.
