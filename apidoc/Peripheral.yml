summary: A remote peripheral device.
description: |
    The CBPeripheral class represents remote peripheral devices that your app discovers with a central manager (an instance of CentralManager).
    In iOS, Peripherals use universally unique identifiers (UUIDs), to identify themselves. For Android, Peripherals use address to be uniqely identified.
    Peripherals may contain one or more services or provide useful information about their connected signal strength.

        Writes the value of a characteristic descriptor. 
        This method copies the data passed into the data parameter, and you can dispose of it after the method returns.
        Note (iOS): You can’t use this method to write the value of a client configuration descriptor (represented by the BLE.CBUUID_CLIENT_CHARACTERISTIC_CONFIGURATION_STRING constant),
        which describes the configuration of notification or indications for a characteristic’s value. 
        If you want to manage notifications or indications for a characteristic’s value, you must use the subscribeToCharacteristic({characteristic:}) and unsubscribeFromCharacteristic({characteristic:}) method instead.
        Another Note (iOS): Once published, you can’t update the value dynamically. Reference (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth/cbmutabledescriptor/1518999-init)
